## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
The project's main goal is to create and execute a website's header & footer sections, which are seen at the top & bottom of pages. These sections are vital to the user experience since they give users access to important information, navigation choices, and contact data.

These header & footer sections are meant to provide users with quick access to important elements like the website's logo, navigation links to other parts like About, Blog, and Contact, and contact details like phone numbers, email addresses, and physical locations. A subscription form enables users to get newsletters or updates, while social media buttons help them interact with the website's social media profiles.

The project makes use of CSS for style and layout modifications, FontAwesome icons for decorative and useful features like social media icons, and HTML for organizing the content of the footer sections.It has static and animated version for comparison. To guarantee that the header & footer sections stay aesthetically pleasing and useful across a range of screen sizes and devices, the implementation also prioritizes responsive design principles.
